     <p>I have always been fascinated with how things work and finding solutions to complex problems. 
        Becoming an engineer would allow me to combine my love for math and science with my passion 
        for innovation and creativity. 
        I believe that pursuing a career in engineering will provide me with the
         opportunity to make a positive impact on the world by 
        developing new technologies and improving existing systems.</p>
