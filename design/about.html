     <h1>About me</h1>

     <p>I have always been fascinated with how things work and finding solutions to complex problems. 
        Becoming an engineer would allow me to combine my love for math and science with my passion 
        for innovation and creativity. 
        I believe that pursuing a career in engineering will provide me with the
         opportunity to make a positive impact on the world by 
        developing new technologies and improving existing systems.</p>
 
       <p>Furthermore engineering offers a diverse range of opportunities for specialization, 
        from mechanical and civil enginerring to computer and electrical engineering. 
        This allows me to explore potentially specialize in an area that aligns with my interests and strengths.
         I am particularly drawn to the idea of working in sustainable engineering,</p>
